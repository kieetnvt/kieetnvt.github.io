Hey there! I’m Kiet Nguyen, your friendly neighborhood Ruby on Rails developer. When I’m not busy wrangling code and wrestling with databases, you might find me moonlighting as a Node.js developer (because hey, who needs sleep?). I’m like a Swiss Army knife of web development – back-end, front-end, whatever-end – I’ve got it covered. :D

I thrive on making scalable, efficient apps, but don’t worry, I still break things… just to make sure I can fix them even better. Let’s build something awesome (and probably debug it later)!
